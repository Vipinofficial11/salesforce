# Salesforce Batch Sink


Description
-----------
A batch sink that inserts sObjects into Salesforce.
Examples of sObjects are opportunities, contacts, accounts, leads, any custom objects, etc.

Currently, only inserts are supported. Upserts are not supported.

Configuration
-------------

**Use Connection:** Whether to use a connection. If a connection is used, you do not need to provide the credentials.

**Connection:** Name of the connection to use. Object Names information will be provided by the connection.
You also can use the macro function ${conn(connection-name)}.  

**Reference Name:** Name used to uniquely identify this sink for lineage, annotating metadata, etc.

**Username:** Salesforce username.

**Password:** Salesforce password.

**Security Token:** Salesforce security token. If the password does not contain the security token, the plugin 
will append the token before authenticating with Salesforce.

**Consumer Key:** Application Consumer Key. This is also known as the OAuth client  ID.
A Salesforce connected application must be created in order to get a consumer key.

**Consumer Secret:** Application Consumer Secret. This is also known as the OAuth client secret.
A Salesforce connected application must be created in order to get a client secret.

**Login URL:** Salesforce OAuth2 login URL.

**Connect Timeout:** Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for connection initialization before it times out.

**SObject Name:** Salesforce object name to insert records into.

There are also **sObjects** that are not supported in the Bulk API of Salesforce.
When a job is created using an object that is not supported in the Bulk API, "_Entity is not supported by the Bulk API_" is thrown.
These objects are also not supported by _Einstein Analytics_ as it also uses Bulk API for querying data.

Below is a non-comprehensive list of **sObjects** that are not currently available in the Bulk API:
- *Feed (e.g. AccountFeed, AssetFeed, ...)
- *Share (e.g. AccountBrandShare, ChannelProgramLevelShare, ...)
- *History (e.g. AccountHistory, ActivityHistory, ...)
- *EventRelation (e.g. AcceptedEventRelation, DeclinedEventRelation, ...)

**Operation:** Operation used for writing data into Salesforce.  
Insert - adds records.  
Upsert - upserts the records. Salesforce will decide if sObjects 
are the same using external ID field.  
Update - updates existing records based on Id field.

**Upsert External ID Field:** External id field name. It is used only if operation is upsert.
The field specified can be either 'Id' or any customly created field, which has external id attribute set.

**Concurrency Mode:** The concurrency mode for the bulk job. Select one of the following options:  
Parallel - Process batches in parallel mode.  
Serial - Process batches in serial mode. Processing in parallel can cause lock contention. When this is severe, 
the Salesforce job can fail. If youâ€™re experiencing this issue, in the Salesforce sink, change concurrency mode to 
Serial and run the pipeline again. This mode guarantees that batches are processed one at a time, but can 
significantly increase the processing time.  
Default is Parallel.

**Max Records Per Batch:** Maximum number of records to include in a batch when writing to Salesforce.
This value cannot be greater than 10,000.

**Max Bytes Per Batch:** Maximum size in bytes of a batch of records when writing to Salesforce.
This value cannot be greater than 10,000,000.

**Error Handling:** Strategy used to handle erroneous records.  
Skip on error - Ignores erroneous records.  
Fail on error - Fails pipeline due to erroneous record.
